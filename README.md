# node-express-rest-api
Personal experiment to teach myself Express.js, making REST API's to query data and using ajax to display data.

## Third iteration
Using ajax to submit forms to avoid page refreshes and redirects

## Second iteration
Using views instead of local files and let the server render the pages
- On home page: Using api call to fetch data and display it using ajax and jquery
- On details page: Using the route to send data and display them using ejs

## First iteration
Local files to query data and display them. Kinda hacked together
